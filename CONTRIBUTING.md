### Following our coding conventions

To format the python test files we use [black](https://github.com/psf/black).
After installing like this you can run the following before committing:
```bash
make format
```

You can also run the following to automatically format all the files that you
have changed before committing.

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << __EOF__
#!/bin/bash
black --check --quiet . || { black .; exit 1; }
__EOF__
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Running tests

In one shell start a docker compose citus cluster:
```bash
docker-compose --project-name django-multitenant up -d || { docker-compose logs && false ; }
```

Then in another shell run the tests:

```bash
export DJANGO_VERSION=4.1
export CITUS_VERSION=11.2
make test-dependencies 
make test
```

#### Running GIS Tests

In order to run the tests ensure that you set the `DJANGO_MULTITENANT_GIS_TESTS` environment variable to `True`:

```shell
export DJANGO_MULTITENANT_GIS_TESTS=True

export DJANGO_VERSION=4.1
export CITUS_VERSION=11.2
make test-dependencies 
make test
```
